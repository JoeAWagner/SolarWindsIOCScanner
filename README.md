Download the file called "SolarWindsIOC-CONFIG MAILER.bat".

You will need to configure the script to use your existing mail server (or an isp/smarthost in your service area).

Instructions and how this works are in "SolarWinds Breach and Detection" document. 

The "SolarWindsIOC-local.bat" script will require no configuration.  Just run it as admin and it will show results in temp folder when done.

Stay tuned for updates and changes.
